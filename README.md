# ourolang
An experiment at making my own programming language
For now ouro only has hello worlds and number prints, but it's ready to be extended to do more given the bison + lex source and that it separates integers from strings.

To compile the source at Ubuntu Linux and other Debian-based distros, install bison and flex

sudo apt install bison
sudo apt install flex

and run the command:

make
